Tic-Tac-Toe Game Suite

Project Overview

This repository presents a robust suite of three distinct Tic-Tac-Toe game implementations, each designed to showcase unique gameplay mechanics and AI strategies. Built with precision, these versions cater to both casual players and developers interested in game development and AI algorithms.
Implementations

1. Two-Player Mode:A classic head-to-head experience where two human players take turns to outsmart each other on the 3x3 grid. Perfect for friendly competition and intuitive gameplay.

2. AI with Random Input: A single-player mode featuring an AI opponent that selects moves randomly. This version offers a lighthearted challenge, ideal for casual play or testing basic AI integration.

3. Minimax AI: A sophisticated single-player mode powered by the Minimax algorithm, enabling the AI to make optimal moves by evaluating all possible game outcomes. This implementation highlights advanced AI decision-making for a formidable challenge.


Purpose:
This project serves as both an engaging game collection and an educational resource. It demonstrates the progression from simple multiplayer mechanics to complex AI-driven strategies, making it valuable for learning game development, algorithm design, and AI concepts.
